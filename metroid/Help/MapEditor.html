The Metroid Map<br>
</b></font>In the Metroid game's program the world map is
stored in a 32 by 32 grid of screen indices. The map does not specify which
level each screen belongs to, only the screen index. <i> This is important to
understand</i>. As you play the game and scroll from screen to screen the game
simply loads the screens from the level you are currently in. When you go up or
down an elevator the game loads data for a different level, and from that point
on the game will display screens from the level you have newly entered. In other
words, the game infers which level each screen on the map belongs to.</font><p><font face="Trebuchet MS">Editroid's map, or the &quot;editor map,&quot; uses
color coding to indicate which level each screen belongs to. But this
information is not taken from the ROM, since this information is not contained
in the ROM in the first place. Editroid can not infer which level each screen
belongs to. The first time you load a ROM, Editroid guesses which level each
screen belongs to. If it guesses wrong, you need to make the necessary
corrections to the editor map. Every time you save the ROM, the editor map is
saved along-side the ROM data.</font></p>
<p><font face="Trebuchet MS">Simply changing the colors on the
editor map will not necessarily have any change in the game, and it is
very possible to make the map in the editor to show something different from what
will be seen in the game. When a room is added to the
map, the level it will belong to should be marked on the editor so that the
editor will know which level's data to use when the screen is displayed and
edited. It is also important to remove a screen from the editor map if it will
no longer be used, in order to maintain organization.</font></p>
<p><font face="Trebuchet MS">Screens that appear black in color on the map are
marked in the game data as inactive. During game play, the screen will not
scroll into these rooms. If an unobstructed path leads to an inactive screen
then the player can walk off the edge of the screen and will not be able to see
Samus (and, most likely, won't be able to get back into the visible part of the
level).</font></p>

<font face="Trebuchet MS" color="#008000">How To Use The Map Editor</font></b><font face="Trebuchet MS"><br>
Left-click a screen to bring it up for editing. If you want to delete a
screen from the map, right-click it. To &quot;paint&quot; on the map, hold shift
and then left-click on a square that is the color you want to paint with, and
then, without lifting the button, drag the mouse to copy that color to adjacent
map locations. To cycle an individual map location through different levels,
hold shift and right-click that map location. You can also use the number pad to
change the selected screen on the map.</font>
