Data Editor</b></font></font>
<p><font face="Trebuchet MS">The password that is seen or entered during game
play represents a number of bits of data that indicate which items have been gotten and
which doors have been opened. Each bit of data from the password corresponds to a piece
of password data. Each piece of password data specifies a map location and an
item type or door. When a player dies, the game looks through all pieces of
password data, identifies which ones represent an item that has been gotten, and
constructs the password. Because of this, whenever an item or a red door is
moved, the password data that corresponds to it must be updated.</font></p>
<p><font face="Trebuchet MS">The item editor will usually update password data
entries automatically, but when red doors are moved the associated password data
must be updated manually.</font></p>
<p><font face="Trebuchet MS">The password data editor shows a yellow rectangle
on the map for each password data entry. It also shows a list of all the
entries, displaying the screen coordinates and item type for each entry. To
update the position for a password data entry click on it and drag it. When you
move an entry, check the list and make sure you are moving the right entry; some
screens have multiple entries (for example, an item and a red door). To update the entry
type, just select what the entry represents in the right-most list (choosing
&quot;Invalid&quot; is not recommended).</font></p>
