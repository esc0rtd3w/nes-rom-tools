	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>
		JNesG is a Nintendo Entertainment System Graphics editor program.
		It was designed specifically for the NES, and can not support
		any other system. It is ideal for both NES developers and
		ROM hackers. It is a new program and so it still has some
		refining to do, and likely has many bugs lurking beneath, check the
		readme for info on those kinds of things.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
	<p>
		You need to be familiar with how the NES handles graphics:
		CHR Blocks, Name Tables, palettes, etc. If you're familiar
		with that, you'll probably be fine just playing with it
		for a while. Otherwise, read on.
	</p>

	<h3>Creating your palette</h3>
	<p>
		Just drag the desired color from the master palette over to your
		user palette. If you drag to a mirrored entry, it will mirror
		itself across all mirror entries. To create a new palette click "new".
	</p>
		
	<h3>Drawing Tiles</h3>
	<p>
		Just pick a color and start drawing, pretty standard stuff. If you're
		confused on why sometimes you get an unexpected color, see below.
	</p>	
	<p>
		To the right of the drawing area is the preview, which shows the tile
		at 2x zoom. Once you are satisfied with your tile click and drag
		the preview into a spot in the chr block, wherever you want.
		
	<h3>CHR Blocks</h3>
	<p>
		Not much here, to make a new block click "new", to clear out
		a block click "clear". The white bar just divides between sprite
		and background tiles, which half is which is up to you.
	</p>
	<h3>Name Tables</h3>
	<p>
		Name Tables are handled just like tiles except their "palette"
		is the current active CHR block. Name Tables are either "low"
		or "high", which indicates which half of the CHR Block they get
		their tiles from. Switching between the two doesn't hurt anything,
		your Name Table will just get redrawn with the other half's tiles
		(try it to see what I mean).
	</p>

	<h2>Importing</h2>
	<h3>From iNES ROMs</h3>
	<p>
		Just select "File > Import > from iNES ROM" from the menu or click the little
		import button that has a tiny NES cart on it, then pick the NES rom you want.
		All of the CHR roms from that ROM will be placed into the CHR Manager.
	</p>
	<p>
		JNesG is not capable of importing palettes or name tables. So when you import
		from an iNES ROM, JNesG creates a "reasonable" palette that has four high
		contrasting colors to make it easy to see the tiles, otherwise a palette
		of all black would make it look like the import failed.
	</p>
	<h3>From Binary Files</h3>
	<p>
		Palettes, Name Tables and CHR Blocks can be imported from raw binary
		files that contain only the relevant data. JNesG will try to import
		as many valid components from these files as possible, but will reject
		anything that's not legal. For example if you give JNesG a file to be
		imported as palettes, each 16 byte chunk will be made into a palette,
		as long as each byte is between 0 and 63, any excess bytes will be
		ignored. Any invalid entry (negative or greater than 63) will result
		in zero for that color. Similiar things happen for CHR blocks and name tables.
	</p>
	<p>
		To do this, just select "File > Import > from Binary" from the menu
		or click the little import button, choose your files, and click "import".
	</p>
	
	<h2>Exporting</h2>
	<h3>to an iNES ROM</h3>
	<p>
		Just select "File > Export > to iNES ROM" from the menu or click the
		export button with the little NES cart on it. Then select the ROM
		you want to export into. JNesG will attempt to export <b>all</b> 
		CHR blocks into <b>a copy</b> of the ROM.
	</p>
	<p>
		As many CHR blocks as can fit into the ROM will get exported. If
		not all can fit, then some won't make it and JNesG will let you know.
		If there's too much space then all CHR blocks will get exported and
		the remaining blocks left alone. It's generally best to export
		your blocks into a ROM that has exactly that many blocks, and even
		better still to export blocks into the same ROM you imported from.
	</p>
	<p>
		This exporting takes place in a copy of the ROM, which will be
		named &lt;original name&gt;_exported.nes, and in the same directory
		as the original.
	</p>
	
	<h3>to raw binaries</h3>
	<p>
		This is generally the way to go when creating your graphics for your
		own NES project. Select "File > Export > to Binary" from the main menu,
		or click the export button. A dialog will appear to set how to do the
		export.
	</p>
		<b>Root for file names: </b>First enter the "root" that all created filenames will have. Say you enter
		"mygame", then your palette files will be "mygame_pal.bin", your chr blocks
		will be "mygame_chr.bin", etc.
	</p>
		<b>Export Mode(s): </b>Ignore this option, it doesn't matter what you
		put, only binary is implemented right now. In future versions ascii
		mode will allow you to export your data to text files in common 6502
		assembly syntaxes, in case people want it that way. I'm sure most 
		will use binary.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>What should be exported: </b>Just check what you want to export
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Save each type to multiple files: </b>This may not be what you think it is.
		Palettes, CHR blocks and name tables are always exported into their own files.
		This option determines whether to put all palettes into one file or
		split each one off into their own files, which will be of the form
		mygame_pal0.bin, mygame_pal1.bin, mygame_pal2.bin, etc. It's not possible 
		to export everything into one file, however you can just use JNesG's internal
		save format if you want (see below).
	</p>
	
	<h2>Other things</h2>
	
	<p>
		<b>Unexpected colors when drawing tiles...</b>
		<br>
		A little investigating should make it obvious why, and remember this is a graphics
		program specifically made for the NES. A tile can only have the values
		0 through 3, but there's 16 colors in the palette. So the palette is split
		into 4 subpalettes, and which ever subpalette is selected (the two bit binary
		buttons above the palette, which is not implemented just yet) determines which subpalette is used to draw
		the tile at any given moment. Despite one subpalette always being the selected
		one, you can select any color in the palette to draw with. I haven't bothered
		to change that. The tiles will get saved to disk as just being arrays of
		numbers between 0 and 3, the colors are only there for your reference and don't
		really matter, as a sprite's "subpalette" must get determined elsewhere in
		an NES game. Read Yoshi's NES doc or Marat's NES doc for more information.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Attribute tables...</b>
		<br>
		There's a lot of things I'd like to put into JNesG, and will eventually.
		Attribute tables are coming. See the readme in the distribution for
		a list of "todo's".
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Loading another master palette...</b>
		<br>
		In future versions, this will probably be doable. If you really want to change it now,
		it's actually not that hard, just requires a recompile. In the source
		(which, if you don't have, can be had from my website), head to
		jnesg/palette/MasterPalette.java. Scroll down a bit and you'll see
		a huge array literal full of PaletteEntry objects, the hex triplets
		in each constructor is the rgb value for that palette entry. Change
		as you like, and recompile (use ant, the source has a build file).
