1.  Introduction 
______________________________________________________________________________________

Quarrel is a level editor for the NES game Battle City. It is written in Delphi,
so it runs under most new operating systems. It has the following features:

 - Can view/edit all levels including the demo level.
 - Can export levels to a separate file and import them back again.
 - Can edit the TSA and attributes of any of the 16 map blocks.
 - Can edit the starting position of the enemy tanks, and your tanks
 - Can edit the flag TSA
 - Can edit the tank you start with
 - Can edit the lives you start with.

4.  FAQ
______________________________________________________________________________________

These are just questions that I have decided to put together. They aren't really
questions that have been asked, but I forsee them being asked.

Q. You are aware that you can open any ROM in this?

A. Yes, I am fully aware of this. I may put in some kind of protection to stop
   people from opening anything but an iNES rom, but if someone manages to code
   an emulator that can run the UNIF rom, then this would be pointless. The iNES
   format isn't designed to give explicit information about games. All it gives
   is information on mapper numbers, mirroring, etc. Anyways, if you want to be
   a twat and try and break Quarrel, then be my guest. It won't get you any
   respect.

Q. I open a ROM, and it appears with strange graphics and colours! What's 
   happening? Am I tripping again?

A. You probably opened the wrong ROM. The GoodNES rom that you want is 
   Battle City (J). All other versions are unsupported at this time. There is also
   an overdumped copy of the ROM out there, and this will load in Quarrel, however,
   edits will not be reflected in the actual game which is ran on an emulator.

Q. I look in the datafiles, and all I see is garbage! What's the meaning of this?

A. Well, the data files are encrypted basically. It also makes me look like less of
   an idiot, as I had to compensate for those bloody ladders.

Q. I opened up DahrkDaiz's hacked Battle City ROM, and it didn't work. Will you add 
   support for this ROM?

A. Yes, in the future. I will also add in a few extra features such as level adding
   in the future also.

5.  Bugs/Suggestions 
______________________________________________________________________________________

If you find any bugs, or have any suggestions (not ones like make it faster, 
as unless you provide code which you know is faster than mine, you'll be 
getting the middle finger son) pm me. Or e-mail me. You can also contact me 
at the Dragon Eye Studios board, if you just want to give suggestions and stuff.
